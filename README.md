Our client DriverPass desires a better working system for their website. The system is intended to offer the better skills of driving students, hoping to pass the DMV driving test to get a license. The desire system should allow users to create an account, take practice tests, choose a package, sign up for online classes, and make an appointment for a driving lesson with an instructor. 

I really believe that I did well explaining what the system needs. I think I can explain functional requirements well, such as users creating accounts, choosing packages and making appointments. And nonfunctional 

Requirements such as security and scalability. 

If I do it over again, I will probably pick other limitations instead of "stuffing". I also should go into more detail on the client side, explaining what the client needs and wants.

When designing the system, the user's perspective is the most important. The user wants to better their driving skills. That is why they are using the website in the first place. The website should be

Easy to use and navigate. If things are too complicated, the websites' success will decline. 

Designing software is like designing a building. There should be a plan before getting started. But there maybe issues that require a change in the plan. System design should be flexible, and 

the wants and needs of the client could change. One should pay attention to the hard things first before going over the easy parts.
