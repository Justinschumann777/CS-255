# CS-255
Our client DriverPass desire a better working system for their website. The system that they desire should allow users to create a account, take practice tests, choose a package, sign up for online classes,
and make a appointment for a driving lesson with a instructor. 
I really believe that I did well explaining what the system needs. I think I explain well on fuctional requriements such as users creating accounts, choosing packages and making appointments. And nonfunctional 
requriements such as secruity and scalability. 
If I will do it over again, I probebbly pick other limitations instead of "stuffing". I also should gone into more detail on the client side, expalining what the client needs and wants.
When desgining the system, the user's perspective is the most importent. The user wants to better their drving skills, that why they are using the website in the frist place. The website should be
easily to use and navirgate. If things are too complicated, the websites success will decline. 
Desgining softeware is like desgining a building, there should be a plan blueprint before getting started. But there maybe issues that requre a change in plan. System desgin should be flexable, and 
the wants and needs of the client could change. One should pay attendtion to the hard things frist before going over the easy parts.
